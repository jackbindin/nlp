Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said he is "winning average games" for the first time in his life after Mohamed Salah sealed a narrow victory at Huddersfield that keeps them level on points with Premier League leaders Manchester City.

Salah's 50th goal in English football came courtesy of a smart low finish, as he put away Xherdan Shaqiri's 24th-minute through ball to dampen a mood matching Huddersfield's bright start.

Egypt forward Salah was visibly buoyed, having failed to score in his previous four appearances, but Huddersfield reacted positively as they twice went close to equalising before half-time.
