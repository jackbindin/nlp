Twenty-six members of a gang which smuggled drugs stashed inside toilets and cat litter into the UK have been jailed.

The group, based in Liverpool, ran a "sophisticated" operation using fake companies to flood North West England with drugs worth millions, police said.

Gang bosses spent their cash on jewellery, designer clothes, cars and luxury holidays.

Ringleader Ian Spackman, 37, was jailed for 17 years and four months.

The gang stashed cannabis inside the cat litter and toilets, and also smuggled heroin and cocaine to Lancashire, Cumbria and Teesside, police said.
