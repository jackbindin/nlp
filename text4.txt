Mr Museveni is the second president Kanye has met in a week, after he spoke to Donald Trump on Thursday.

"It is an odd meeting," says Dr Jonathan Fisher, who is an expert in African politics at the University of Birmingham.

"But President Museveni is known to be quite savvy with the media," he says.

Dr Fisher thinks that meeting with Kim and Kanye is a way for Mr Museveni to put himself on Donald Trump's radar - after all, we know Kanye and Trump get on.

The benefits to Uganda could come in the form of military training, arms and development money from the US if Mr Museveni gets in Trump's good books.
